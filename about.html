                <strong>Little Bites</strong> is a bakery shop located in the Malejor neighborhood of Adenta Dodowa Road. 
                Serving sourdough breads, pies, conchas, and a variety of croissants, we use French baking techniques and 
                locally inspired flavors to create a rotating menu of handcrafted baked goods. 
                The menu also features many plant-based options.
